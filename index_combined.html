    <h1>Who's Afraid of Big Government?: Exploring Trends in Public Employment </h1>
    <div id = "introtext">
        <p> A point of interest and research in my graduate studies has been the development, ownership, and governance of technology and technical systems. As part of that work I’ve been interested in the role of the state and public ownership of infrastructure, vs. the role of private profit-seeking interests. When reviewing the Census data I noticed that the economic data collected includes public employment numbers. Since I’m already interested in the interaction between public and private sectors, this data piqued my interest.</p>
        <p> Using that employment data, I’d like to ask (and answer) this broad question: <ital>Can we identify any trends by looking at public employment numbers broken down by state?</ital></p>
        <p> Public employment numbers can be used as a proxy for the “size” of the state/government. They can provide a sense of what portion of the economy is under direct public oversight and management. Historically, at least rhetorically, Republicans have been associated with favoring “small government” (less regulation, less government intervention, investment, social services, etc.) whereas Democrats have been associated with a preference for “big government.”</p>
        <p> I opted to create some interactive tools that let the user examine public employment data in more detail, along with offering a window into other factors that may help illustrate teh political economy of each state individually. My project implements an interactive map that allows users to compare the data state-by-state. This is complemented by a bar graph ranking the states, as well as a toggleable scatter plot that allows for various comparisons to be made.</p> 
        <p> Some of the factors that can be examined in relation to public employment rates are:<br>
            * Total workforce (as an appropriate proxy for population)<br>
            * Unemployment rates<br>
            * GDP<br> 
            * Political party affiliation/governance</p>  
        <p>The goal is to create a tool that offers an easy access point to granular public employment numbers. It will allow users to test or challenge their own assumptions about small vs. big government, and ideally serve as a grounding point to further research.</p>

    <h3>Data Sources and Analysis</h3>
    <div id = "datatext">
    <p>- [U.S. Census Data](https://data.census.gov/mdat/#/search?ds=ACSPUMS1Y2021&cv=COW&rv=ucgid&wt=PWGTP&g=0400000US01,02,04,05,06,08,09,10,11,12,13,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,53,54,55,56) I was able to find good data on public employment numbers, total employment numbers, and classification of workers by state. Unfortunately the other economic data I was looking for initially, on wages and poverty, proved much more difficult to work with on the state level.

        - [Political Party Data](https://github.com/CivilServiceUSA/us-governors/blob/master/us-governors/data/us-governors.csv) There are many metrics by which to determine political affiliation, but since I was looking at state-level differences, I opted to go with the simple metric of the Governor’s party affiliation. In most states, the Governor as chief executive has great influence, if not ultimate authority, over state spending.    
        
        - [State GDP Data](https://apps.bea.gov/regional/histdata/releases/0321gdpstate/index.cfm) The last full and reliable data from this report was 2019.</p>
